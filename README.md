Simplified benchmark for PK project based on my old project: https://github.com/Kot97/parallel_benchmark

Problem: Finding maximum value in vector  

Project structure:  
    /src/ - contain solutions of problem in C and C++  
    /benchmark/ - contain code which generate time data  
    /test/ - contain unit tests of solutions  

Build system: CMake  
Unit tests: googletest  
Benchmarks: googlebenchmark
